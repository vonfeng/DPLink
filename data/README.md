This data(Weibo-ISP) is used in our paper `DPLink: User Identity Linkage via Deep Neural Network From Heterogeneous Mobility Data.`

We have collected and processed this data in collaboration with our partners, and it is intended for academic use only. Redistribution of this data is not permitted without our explicit permission.

# Data
The ISP dataset contains 325215 mobility records that cover the metropolitan area of Shanghai from April 19 to April 26 in 2016. The data contains four parts as follows
- isp           # dense trajectory, you should first extract the isp.zip file before processing
- weibo         # sparses trajectory
- baseLoc       # location info
- poi_info.json # location info with POI

You can process these data by using codes in [preprocessing](https://github.com/vonfeng/DPLink/blob/master/codes/preprocessing.py), including functions, `load_vids` for baseLoc and poi_info.json, `load_data_match_telecom` for isp, and `load_data_match_sparse` for weibo
